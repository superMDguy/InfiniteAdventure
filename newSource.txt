Normally, I would attempt to rectify your condition, but I'm ashamed

You clearly are a suicidal maniac.  We don't allow psychotics in the
dungeon, since they may harm other adventurers.  Your remains will be
installed in the Land of the Living Dead, where your fellow adventurers
may gloat over them.
Shall I patch you up? 
Now, let me see...[line break]Well, we weren't quite able to restore your state.  You can't have everything.
What?  You don't trust me?  Why, only last week I patched a running
ITS and it survived for over 30 seconds.  Oh, well.
As you take your last breath, you feel relieved of your burdens.  The feeling passes as you find yourself before the gates of Hell, where the spirits jeer at you and deny you entry.  Your senses are disturbed.  The objects in the dungeon appear indistinct, bleached of color, even

Forest
This is a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  One particularly large tree with some low branches stands here.
You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.
You are about ten feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The nearest branch above you is beyond your reach.
On the branch is a small birds nest.  
In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged somewhere by a childless songbird.  The egg is covered with fine gold inlay and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl.  Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and has a delicate looking clasp holding it closed. The egg appears extremely fragile.

There is a golden clockwork canary nestled in the egg.  It seems to have recently had a bad experience.  The mountings for its jewel-like eyes are empty, and its silver beak is crumpled.  Through a cracked crystal window below its left wing you can see the remains of intricate machinery.  It is not clear what result winding it would have, as the mainspring appears sprung.
There is an unpleasant grinding noise from inside the canary.

This is a golden clockwork canary.  It has ruby eyes and a silver beak.  Through a crystal window below its left wing you can see intricate machinery inside.  It appears to have wound down.
The canary chirps, slightly off key, an aria from a forgotten opera.
From out of the greenery flies a lovely song bird.  It perches on a
limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing.  As it does so,
a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top
of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass.  As the canary winds
down, the song bird flies away.
The canary chirps blithely, if somewhat tinnily, for a short time.
This is a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  To the east, there appears to be sunlight.

With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room. With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.
Having moved the carpet previously, you find it impossible to move it again.
You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its south wall.  From here there is a marvelous view of the Canyon and parts of the Frigid River
upstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs still
appear to loom far above.  Following the Canyon upstream (north and
northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow. 
Fortunately, my vision is better than average and I can discern the
top of the Flood Control Dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the
west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles
around.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.
You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon.
You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists
along a passage which it is impossible to enter.  Below you is the
canyon bottom.  Above you is more cliff, which still appears
climbable.
You are beneath the walls of the river canyon which may be climbable
here.  There is a small stream here, which is the lesser part of the
runoff of Aragain Falls. To the north is a narrow path.
You are on a small, rocky beach on the continuation of the Frigid River past the Falls.  The beach is narrow due to the presence of the White Cliffs.  The river canyon opens here and sunlight shines in from above. A rainbow crosses over the falls to the west and a narrow path continues to the southeast.
You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading east, and a crawlway to the south.  On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.
You attempt to climb the ramp, but it is too slippery, and you slide back down.
This is a small room with passages off in all directions. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the
walls.
[if the troll is consious]A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.[otherwise]There is an unconsious troll here.[end if]

The unconscious troll cannot defend himself:  He dies.
Almost as soon as the troll breathes his last breath, a cloud
of sinister black fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the
carcass has disappeared.
You are on the west edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be seen. The east side is sheer rock, providing no exits. A narrow passage goes west.  The path you are on continues to the north and south.
The chasm probably leads directly to the infernal regions.
This is an art gallery. Most of the paintings which were here have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste. The vandals left through the north, south, or west exits.
Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on the far wall is a work of unparalleled beauty.

This is what appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors. Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here. At the north and northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint). An extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace. Although you might be able to get up the chimney, it seems unlikely that you could get back down.
The chimney is too narrow for you and your baggage.
Only Santa Claus climbs down chimneys.
Going up empty-handed is a bad idea.
This is the large entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest banking institution of the Great Underground Empire. A partial account of its history is in 'The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads' with the chapter on J. Pierpont Flathead. A more detailed history (albeit less objective) may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography 'I'm Rich and You Aren't -- So There!'
Most of the furniture has been ravaged by passing scavengers. All that
remains are two signs at the northwest and northeast corners of the room, which say

This is a large rectangular room. The east and west walls here were used for storing safety deposit boxes. As might be expected, all have been carefully removed by evil persons. The northern 'wall' of the room is a shimmering curtain of light. To the east, west, and south of the room are large doorways.
In the center of the room is a large stone cube, about 10 feet on a side. Engraved on the side of the cube is some lettering.

A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere adventurers), blocks the staircase.  From his state of health
and the bloodstains on the walls, you gather that he is not very friendly, though he likes people
The cyclops is standing in the corner, eyeing you closely.  I don't think he likes you very much.  He looks extremely hungry, even for a cyclops
The cyclops, having eaten the hot peppers, appears to be gasping. His inflamed tongue protrudes from his man-sized mouth
The cyclops is sleeping blissfully at the foot of the stairs
The north wall, previously solid, now has a cyclops-shaped hole in it
[cyclops text].
The cyclops, hearing the name of his father's deadly nemesis, flees the room by knocking down the wall on the north side of the room.
I don't see any cylcops here.
The cyclops does not take to kindly to being grabbed.
The cyclops doesn't look like he'll let you pass.
The cyclops may be hungry, but there is a limit.
The cyclops is apparently not thirsty and refuses your generosity.
The cyclops looks tired and quickly falls fast asleep (what did you put in that drink, anyway?).
The cyclops is not so stupid as to eat that!
The cyclops says, 'Mmm mmm!  I love hot peppers!  But oh, could I use a drink.  Perhaps I could drink the blood of that thing.' From the gleam in his eye, it could be surmised that you are 'that thing'.
This is a long passage.  To the south is one entrance.  On the east there is an old wooden door with a large hole in it (about
cyclops sized).
This is a narrow east-west passageway.  There is a narrow stairway leading down at the north end of the room.
This is a deep ravine at a crossing with an east-west crawlway.  Some stone steps are at the south of the ravine, and a steep staircase descends.
[if the pdl1 is on-stage]This is a long room on the south shore of a large reservoir.[otherwise]You are in a long room, to the north of which was formerly a reservoir.[end if]  There is a western exit, a passageway south, and a steep pathway climbing up along the edge of a cliff.
The stairs are to steep for you with your burden.
This is a circular room with passages off in eight directions.
Your compass needle spins wildly, and you cannot get your bearings.
Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell directions in here.
You are standing in a small circular room with a pedestal.  A set of stairs leads up, and passages leave to the east and west.
There is an extremely valuable (perhaps original) grail here.

This is a narrow crawlway.  The crawlway leads from north to south. However, the south passage divides to the south and southwest.
This is the west end of a large temple.  On the south wall is an ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language. The north wall is solid granite.  The entrance at the west end of the room is through huge marble pillars.
prayer
The prayer is inscribed in an ancient script which is hardly remembered these days, much less understood.  What little of it can be made out seems to be a diatribe against small insects, absent-mindedness, and the picking up and dropping of small objects.  The final verse seems to consign trespassers to the land of the dead.  All evidence indicates that the beliefs of the ancient Zorkers were obscure.
This is the east end of a large temple.  In front of you is what appears to be an altar.
On the two ends of the altar are burning candles.
There are two candles here.
On the altar is a large black book, open to page 569.

You have entered a cave with passages leading north and southeast.
 There are old engravings on the walls here.
The engravings were incised in the living rock of the cave wall by an unknown hand.  They depict, in symbolic form, the beliefs of the ancient peoples of Zork.  Skillfully interwoven with the bas reliefs are excerpts illustrating the major tenets expounded by the sacred texts of the religion of that time.  Unfortunately, a later age seems to have considered them blasphemous and just as skillfully excised them.

This is a tiny cave with entrances west and north, and a dark, forbidding staircase leading down.
Tiny Cave
You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed: [paragraph break]
[8 spaces]'Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here.'[paragraph break]
The gate is open; through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some hideous fate, can be heard.
You have entered the Land of the Living Dead, a large desolate room.  Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the sounds of thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning.  In the east corner are
stacked the remains of dozens of previous adventurers who were less
fortunate than yourself.  To the east is an ornate passage,
apparently recently constructed.  A passage exits to the west.
This is the Tomb of the Unknown Implementer. A hollow voice says:  'That's not a bug, it's a feature!'
In the north wall of the room is the Crypt of the Implementers.  It is made of the finest marble, and apparently large enough for four headless corpses.  The crypt is [if the crypt is open]open[otherwise]closed[end if].  Above the entrance is the cryptic instruction: 'Feel Free'.
Though large and aesthetically pleasing the marble crypt is empty; the sarcophagi, bodies, and rich treasure to be expected in a tomb of this magnificence are missing. Inscribed on one wall is the motto of the implementers, 'Feel Free'.  There is a door leading out of the crypt to the south.  The door is [if the crypt is open]open[otherwise]closed[end if].
Although the implementers are dead, they foresaw that some cretin
would tamper with their remains.  Therefore, they took steps to
punish such actions.
Unfortunately, we've run out of poles.  Therefore, in punishment for
your most grievous sin, we shall deprive you of all your valuables,
and of your life.
Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat
disoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.  
As you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you,
and says, 'You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of
Zork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the
future, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time
transport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say
	INCANT '<word>'
and you will be told your own magic phrase to use by saying
	INCANT '<word> <phrase>'
Good luck, and choose wisely!'
Some invisible force prevents you from passing through the gate.
Ding Dong.[paragraph break]
The bell suddenly becomes red hot and falls to the ground. The
wraiths, as if paralyzed, stop their jeering and slowly turn to face
you.  On their ashen faces, the expression of a long-forgotten terror
takes shape.
In your confusion, the candles drop to the ground (and they are out).
The tension of this ceremony is broken, and the wraiths, amused but
shaken at your clumsy attempt, resume their hideous jeering.
[description of the black book][paragraph break]
Each word of the prayer reverberates through the hall in a deafening
confusion.  As the last word fades, a voice, loud and commanding,
speaks: 'Begone, fiends!'.  A heart-stopping scream fills the cavern, 
and the spirits, sensing a greater power, flee through the walls.

Guide Book to
Flood Control Dam #3
Flood Control Dam #3 (FCD#3) was constructed in year 783 of the
Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
zorkmids from the Central Bureaucracy and your omnipotent local
tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive. This impressive
structure is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet
tall at the center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir
created behind the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an
area of 12 million square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand
feet.[paragraph break]
The construction of FCD#3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
the dedication. It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
tree. The work was managed by a command team composed of 2345
bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom can type),
12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
processors, and nearly one million dead trees.[paragraph break]
We will now point out some of the more interesting features
of FCD#3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities.  You start your tour here in the Dam Lobby.  You will notice on your right that .........

Frigid River
You cannot go upstream due to strong currents.
You are on the River Frigid in the vicinity of the Dam.  The river flows quietly here.  There is a landing on the west shore.
The River turns a corner here making it impossible to see the
Dam.  The White Cliffs loom on the east bank and large rocks prevent
landing on the west.
The river descends here into a valley.  There is a narrow beach on
the east below the cliffs and there is some shore on the west which may be suitable.  In the distance a faint rumbling can be heard.
The river is running faster here and the sound ahead appears to bethat of rushing water.  On the west shore is a sandy beach.  A small area of beach can also be seen below the Cliffs.
The sound of rushing water is nearly unbearable here.  On the west
shore is a large landing area.
 
Unfortunately, a rubber raft doesn't provide much protection from the unfriendly sorts of rocks and boulders one meets at the bottom of many waterfalls.  Including this one.
There is a red buoy here (probably a warning).
The White Cliffs prevent your landing here.
You are on the west shore of the river.  An entrance to a cave is
to the northwest.  The shore is very rocky here.
You are on a narrow strip of beach which runs along the base of the White Cliffs. The only path here is a narrow one, heading south
along the Cliffs.

You are on the shore of the River.  The river here seems somewhat treacherous.  A path travels from north to south here, the south end quickly turning around a sharp corner.
You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous waterfall with a drop of about 450 feet.  The only path here is on the north end.  [if rainbow flag is true]A solid rainbow spans the falls.[otherwise]A beautiful rainbow can be seen over the falls and to the east.[end if]
You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would walk on a rainbow), with a magnificent view of the Falls.  The rainbow travels east-west here.  There is an NBC Commissary here.

Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture,
walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).

The structure rocks back and forth slightly but doesn't move.
The pine wall swings open.
There is no way out.
This is a narrow room whose east wall is a large mirror.  Somewhat to the north, identical stone statues face each other from pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped around formidable bludgeons.

The dungeon master is taken momentarily by surprise.  He dodges your
blow and then, with a disappointed expression on his face, he raises
his staff and traces a complicated pattern in the air.  As it
completes you crumble into dust.

The dungeon master, obviously pleased, says 'You are indeed a

The dungeon master is quietly leaning on his staff here.
The thief returns to consiousness.
Time passes...and you die from some obscure poisoning.
The mirror quietly swings shut.
The booming voice asks: From which room can one enter the robber's hideaway without passing through the cyclops room?
The booming voice asks: Besides the Temple, to which room is it possible to go from the Altar?
The booming voice asks: What can be done to the Mirror that is useful?
You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway.  Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.
A seedy-looking individual with a large bag just wandered through the room.  On the way through, he quietly abstracted all valuables from the room and from your possession, mumbling something about 'Doing unto others before...'
A seedy-looking individual with a large bag just wandered through the room.  Finding nothing of value, he left disgruntled.
The dungeon master follows you.
The button pops back to its original position.
A metallic voice says, 'Hello, Intruder!  Your unauthorized presence in the vault area of the Bank of Zork has set off all sorts of nasty surprises, several of which seem to have been fatal.  This message brought to you by the Frobozz Magic Alarm Company.'
An epicene Gnome of Zurich, wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a
 safety deposit box, materializes in the room.  'You seem to have
 forgotten to deposit your valuables,' he says, tapping the lid of the
 box impatiently.  'We don't usually allow customers to use the boxes
 here, but we can make this ONE exception, I suppose...'  He looks
 askance at you over his wire-rimmed bifocals.

The room trembles and 50,000 pounds of rock fall on you, turning you into a pancake.  [if the player is outside]Meteors, no doubt.[end if]
You may recall your recent explosion.  Well, probably as a result of
that, you hear an ominous rumbling, as if one of the rooms in the
dungeon has collapsed.

The ledge collapses, probably as a result of the explosion.  A large
chunk of it, which is attached to the hook, drags you down to the
ground.  Fatally.
The ledge collapses, leaving you with no place to land.
The force of the explosion has caused the ledge to collapse
belatedly.
The ledge collapses, giving you a narrow escape.
Now you've done it.  It seems that the brick has other properties
than weight, namely the ability to blow you to smithereens.
There is an explosion nearby.
You notice that the [list of flaming things in the receptacle] has burned out, and that the cloth bag starts to deflate.
The match has gone out.
It appears that blow was too much for you.  I'm afraid you are dead.
The lamp appears to be getting dimmer.

I hope you have more light than from a lamp.
There is a knocking sound from the front of the house.
Suddenly a sinister wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears
seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible
voice he says, 'I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork. You
have persisted through many trials and tests, and have overcome them
all, dispelling the darkness of ignorance and danger.  One such as
yourself is fit to join even the Implementers!'  He then raises his
oaken staff, and chuckling, drifts away like a wisp of smoke, his
laughter fading in the distance.
This is an east-west corridor which turns north at its eastern and western ends.  The walls of the corridor are marble.  An additional passage leads south at the center of the corridor.
This is a corridor with polished marble walls.  The corridor

This is a large east-west corridor which opens out to a northern
parapet at its center.  You can see flames and smoke as you peer
towards the parapet.  The corridor turns south at its east and west
ends, and due south is a massive wooden door.  In the door is a small
window barred with iron.  The door is [if the prison cell door is open]open[otherwise]closed.[end if]
You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less bottomless.  It also extends upward out of sight.  The pit itself is of roughly dressed stone and circular in shape.  It is about two hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat, so it is rather uncomfortable standing here.
There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face of the dial are numbers 'one' through 'eight'.  The indicator points to the number [dial number in words].
'I prefer to stay where I am, thank you.'

'I'm willing to accompany you, but not ride in your pocket!'
'If you wish,' he replies.

Prison Cell
[5 spaces]This is a room of large size, richly appointed and decorated
in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste.  To judge from its
contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.[paragraph break]
[5 spaces]There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of
zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.[paragraph break]
[5 spaces]In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes as
'The History of the Great Underground Empire,' 'The Lives of the
Twelve Flatheads,' 'The Wisdom of the Implementors,' and other
informative and inspiring works.[paragraph break]
[5 spaces]On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Great Underground
Empire, showing points of interest, various troves of treasure, and
indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.[paragraph break]
[5 spaces]On a desk at the far end of the room may be found stock
certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo
International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company of
the Frobozz Magic Boat Co., etc.[paragraph break]
[5 spaces]As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the Dungeon
Master himself materializes beside you, and says, 'Now that you have solved all the mysteries of the Dungeon, it is time for you to assume your rightly-earned place in the scheme of things.  Long have I waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!'  He taps you lightly on the head with his staff, mumbling a few well-chosen spells,
and you feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For a moment there are two identical mages staring at each other among the treasure, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.
